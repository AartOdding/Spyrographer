Application I made using OpenFrameworks 0.9.3
It is my own take on the game spyrogrph where you can draw crazy spirals using multiple gears.
This comes with a GUI to pick colors, draw the paths the gears move over, and add pencils to draw any spiral you want.

If you want to build this program I recommend first getting a copy of OpenFrameworks, create a new project and copy paste all this code into it, replacing the auto generated files. It should also work with OF versions newer than 0.9.3
